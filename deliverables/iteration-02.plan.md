#### Team Rules

We have a fun and relaxed working culture.

Communications:
For communication within team, we will mainly use Facebook Messenger to discuss and share things, and whenever a group member has a problem, other members can answer and help. Also, we will use Trello to keep track of tasks and the progress of each group member. 
For communication with our partner, we agreed to meet in person once every two weeks on Wednesdays. During each meeting, we will ask our project partner when she’s available next time to meet up and book a room in Gerstein in advance and meet there. In addition, we will send emails when there is something that we have to communicate with the partner to make sure that we are on the right track.
 
Meetings:
We will keep meeting minutes in a Google doc so that everybody can get to know what was discussed during the meeting and the corresponding decisions. For action items, we will use task tracking software such as Trello in order to ensure everyone knows what to do. Members can mark tasks with tags such as not started, in progress or done to show the progress, and also make checklists so that other people know what has been done for a task and which step the member is currently working on. Anyone experiencing difficulties can contact the rest of the group via messenger. Members must attend all regular meetings. If a member misses a meeting, he/she must send a message to the group chat on messenger detailing the reason for their absence, promptly read up on the meeting notes, and explain what he/she will do to make up for the missed meeting.
 
Conflict Resolution:
+ Indecisions:
  - Since our primary source of communication is Messenger, in case the team hits a point where no one is able to come to a conclusion, an effort will be made to schedule a meeting ASAP to ensure that everyone is on the same page. 
+ Decision-making policy:
  - Whenever someone has an idea, he/she must be able to come up with valid reasons to back it up if others do not agree with them. Voting (via poll on messenger) will be our typical solution. If there is a tie, Adam will be the tie-breaker. 
+ Distribution of tasks:
  - We will schedule face to face meetings (one hour before/after tutorial on Tuesdays). They are essential when working on the project because they act as a push factor in making everyone contribute and avoid slacking off. We will also set a deadline for each action item, where the assigned person/sub-group can ask for help if they encounter any difficulties before it is too late. For this to work, we will assess each team member’s skills before delegating tasks. 
+ Non-responsive team members:
  - We will remind ourselves of the importance of this project (worth 50% and FCK’s belief in us) and address the unresponsiveness in an effective and positive way. This, again, can be done by scheduling a meeting so that the individual(s) can express their concerns/opinions and get feedback in a quicker manner. In the unlikely scenario that a team member’s non responsive attitude persists, we will contact a TA. 


#### Events 

We will schedule regular face to face meetings (one hour before/after tutorial on Tuesdays). These regular meetings will be where we make and review weekly plans. The first 15 minutes of these meetings will serve as a “stand up meeting” in the agile process. We will get up to date with the current tasks and resolve issues. After we get updated on each member’s progress, we will create the next weekly plan and assign tasks to each member for the week. After each member is assigned tasks, we will go over all the assignments as a group, and decide whether such assignments will allow us to meet our final goal on time, and make adjustments if necessary.

When a lot of decisions need to be made and discussions are essential in between weekly regular meetings, we will raise a poll and choose a time when most people are available, and for the best case everybody can be present. These meetings can be online or on campus, depending on availability.

The assigned tasks will be updated on Trello, so the entire team can see every team member’s progress at any time. Code reviews will be done online, at members' request. In addition to in person meetings, we will be regularly communicating in the Messenger group chat.

#### Partner Meetings
Our first meeting with partner was held in Gerstein on October 9th which lasted for about one hour. For the planning meeting, we came up with all the questions that needed to be asked in advance. And the first meeting was mainly on the sharing of the overall idea. Our partner introduced the main operations of Feeding Canadian Kid and how everything is done currently in FCK as well as the main requirements for this project. Then we raised our questions and concerns: what are we exactly building, what users are we targeting, what each kind of users need to access from our website, when an email is triggered, what should the manager manage on our website, how large is the scale that we need to support, how the food is allocated, etc. We discussed a lot of things, through the process, we get to know the project requirements better and we know more about what is needed to be accomplished.


#### Artifacts
Trello is a great platform for sharing the group to-do lists. All of the artifacts will be done on Trello including the to-do lists, task boards and schedules. During our discussion, we will figure out the tasks that need to be done, and put them on Trello, where we can keep track of them. Some tasks may be the prerequisites of further tasks, so we will prioritize the prerequisites. Moreover, tasks on main features will be prioritized over task on extension features. The distribution of tasks will be done based on the roles of our team members, as well as the strengths and weaknesses so that we can make full use of everybody’s strengths. After tasks get assigned, corresponding information will be marked on Trello so that the distribution can be seen more clearly.

#### Deployment and Github Workflow
Our workflow starts with assigning yourself a task on our trello board and moving it to the in “in-progress” lane. Once you have claimed a task, a feature branch is created off of master on our Github repo; all work for this task will be done this branch. The naming convention for our feature branches is: “feature/<feature_name>”, where feature_name is the feature being worked on – this should match the feature name on our trello board. Once the work for the task is completed a pull request is created to merge the feature branch into master and code reviewers are assigned. We have chosen to use the feature branch strategy in order to make conflict resolution easier. There are so many of us that if we all push to master there are bound to be lots of conflicts. Additionally, this can make sure that we are always guaranteed to have a working branch (in theory). Team members will be unafraid to and encouraged to commit frequently to their own feature branch, and anyone can pick up a new task at any time, knowing that they will start work on a working codebase.

Pull requests are QA tested to make sure the feature is working as expected and then merged into master.

For deployment of our Express and React servers, we will do one big deployment at the end onto an EC2 server. For now, we are keeping everything local. We are not going to be investing any CI tools for deployment as we are simply going to scp all the files onto the ec2 instance and run our server. We do not think it is worth the opportunity cost to set up a CI pipeline for this project since it is not currently being used by anyone and we really only need it deployed for a demo at the end.

The database is deployed on Google Cloud Platform so that all team members can test their code and ensure that the code is written for a single database schema, and any changes to the database tables will be evident immediately for all team members.


## Product
Note: "Partner" refers to a restaurant partner or program partner, as defined by Feeding Canadian Kids. "Program Partner" refers to Feeding Canadian Kids.
### Goals and Tasks
Our goals for this iteration are to have a website prototype that has the most basic functionality required by our Project Partner. Specifically: complete the user sign up and login page for restaurant partners and program partners, create dashboard for admin to view pending applications and registered partners' info, create dashboard for users (restaurant partners and program partners) to view their paired partners and the number of meals they are expected to deliver/receive, and a page that contains training resources for new program/restaurant partners.

The following tasks(ordered from most to least important) will have to be completed in order to achieve these goals:

1.  As a prospective restaurant/program partner, I want a streamlined application form in a central place so I can join the Feeding Canadian Kids project easily.

	-   AC: prospective restaurant/program partners should be able to submit a form that requests all the required information to apply on the website.
    

3.  As a user, I want to have login credentials so I can securely access my account profile.
    

	-   AC: each user must have their own unique login credentials which only they can use to access their accounts.
    

3.  As a restaurant partner, I want to know how much food I need to send to my partner program so I can plan ahead.
    

	-   AC: Restaurant partners should be able to easily view the amount of food they committed to in their application for each day.
    

4.  As a partner, I want to know how much food I am receiving and which restaurant is providing it so I can plan ahead.
    

	-   AC: Program partners should be able to view the amount of food that the partners they’ve been paired with have committed to them.
    

5.  As an administrator, I want to be notified of new partner requests so I can review and approve them quickly.
    

	-   AC: When a new partner request is added it should be reflected on the page of all Admin users.
    

6.  As an administrator, I want to be able to review and process new partner requests so I can easily add more members in a single, organized place.
    

	-   AC: Admin users will have the ability to click a button on an applicant's
    

7.  As a FCK staff member, I want to easily view the pool of applicants and their information so I can better pair restaurants with programs.
    

	-   AC: FCK staff users should be able to view all program applicant info and all restaurant info.
    

8.  As a potential restaurant partner, I want to know the status of my application so I can be assured that it is under review, and also get to know my required actions.
    

	-   AC: restaurant users should be able to view their application status and any feedback given by FCK staff members.
    

9.  As a new partner, I want to see training resources after I am verified by FCK, so I can start delivering meals/receiving meals as soon as possible.
    

	-   AC: New program/restaurant partners should have access to a page that contain links to training materials after they have been verified by FCK staff.

### Artifacts
 * We will sketch out wireframes in order to create a graphical representation of our website containing the essential elements and the content. Sketching out wireframes requires little amount of time and allow all members to have a higher level understanding of the website’s structure which helps to avoid overlooking something. 
 * We will produce a prototype of our product by the second meeting with our partner so that our partner can experience the content and interactions in the interface which will allow them to provide us with immediate feedback. This prototype includes a fully functioning login page, a dashboard for the admin with dummy data, a dashboard for restaurant partners, and a dashboard for restaurant partners.
 * With the help of https://dbdiagram.io/home, we will sketch out our database model and relationships between entities. By seeing an entity-relationship diagram, we can easily understand relationships among entities.
